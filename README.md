# ESP32Cam_Data
ESP32 Data transmission to Bluetooth App


# Introduction

This project relates to data transfer to phone via Bluetooth. The potentiometer used in this circuit is used to give random values. This random data from the potentiometer is sent to the phone over Bluetooth. The data is directly transmitted to the app specially made for this project i.e. ”ESP32_Bluetooth_Terminal” App.

# Hardware/Software Requirements
1)ESP32 CAM: The ESP32-CAM is a full-featured microcontroller that also has an integrated video camera and microSD card socket.  It’s inexpensive and easy to use, and is perfect for IoT devices requiring a camera with advanced functions like image tracking and recognition.

2)POTENTIOMETER: It gives Values to the Microcontroller.

3)ESP32_Bluetooth_Terminal App: This App is made by using MIT App Inventor.
This app is specially designed to receive the value of the potentiometer over Bluetooth.
